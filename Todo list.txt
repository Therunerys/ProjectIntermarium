############# POSSIBLE CHANGES ###########
- If Ottomans have faced internal conflicts and crisis, it should lose the Lebanon and Palestine to England (i'm going for alt-history) which wanted to secure the area of Egypt. Then the lands of the 
  south, near Red Sea, could be claimed by Italy or UK to totally control the Sea. This could be lead to a war and make more interesting the things.
- Germany historically had part of the Cameroon
- If austria-hungary collapses, it can reform through decisions 
- possible flame troopers ---------------- DONE
